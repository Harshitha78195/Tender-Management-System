##  Database Setup

Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and create necessary tables:
- `users` â€“ Stores user details and roles.
- `tenders` â€“ Stores tender information.
- `bids` â€“ Tracks bids submitted by users.

Example connection configuration:
```java
String url = "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/tenderdb";
String user = "your_username";
String password = "your_password";
